With SYBYL CoMFA no longer readily available, “comfa” is provided as a second program. Its two operations are: generating classical CoMFA models, using SYBYL’s default parameter settings and protocols; and making predictions with those CoMFA models. The only input file contains the aligned structures, each, of course, if a model is to be generated, including the dependent variable (presumably a biological observation) as a structural attribute. (These alignments need not come from tcfa!) “comfa” writes its newly generated CoMFA model to a text file, “model.tcfa”, with its statistical parameters as the first line. This file allows predictions to be made subsequently to model generation. “comfa” also writes the steric and electrostatic “contour maps” to .oesrf files, ready for display by Vida. The values that are being contoured are the second ones in the pairs that make up most of the contents of model.tcfa.Most of comfa’s command-line arguments have an obvious function. However “ncomp” and “samplsall” need some explanation. Here’s some background. CoMFA uses PLS to build its linear models, which will iteratively extract only those field dependencies (aka “components”) that are expressed over the most lattice points by the most structures. The more components, the higher the likelihood of “over-fitting”, degrading the quality of the model’s predictions. SYBYL’s CoMFA and “comfa” use SAMPLS, a very fast variation of cross-validation, to establish the number of components in the model.    However, SAMPLS is very conservative, in particular requiring, in order for a field dependency to emerge, for it to be expressed by more than one structure. At the earliest stages of lead optimization, this condition will often not be met. Therefore “comfa” provides “ncomp” as a manual override. If the use of “ncomp” reveals a one or two component PLS model that fits well, my experience is to take that model seriously.“samplsall” is useful to speed the rather specialized situation of very large data sets, specfically those in the PLOS publication, by limiting the SAMPLS scope to a random subset of the structures producing the model.
